# Pockets Backend
This is an API built for Pockets.

## Technologies
- Node.js using the Express.js framework.
... I picked Express.js as I know it the best and I think for my requirements it suites them.
- TypeScript
*** I decided on TypeScript well for it's types..
- Prisma ORM
... I decided to use Prisma mainly for it's ease of use and great schema and migration tools. I was going to use something like Knex.js a lower level query builder but for this project I think making use of Prisma's *magic* works.
- Postgres
... I picked Postgres because I think it's great ðŸ‘Œ
- Jest
... I chose to use Jest for familiarity but I did consider Mocha for its speeeed.
