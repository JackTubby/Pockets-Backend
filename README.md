## How to run the app in dev
To run the app in development follow these steps:

- Add files to your local editor.
- Docker
  - First check you have docker installed
  - Run the command `docker-compose up` to see logs or `docker-compose up -d` to not see logs.
  - Run Prisma migrations by running the command `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Node server
  - Run the command `npm run dev` to start the server

After this you should now be able to use the API.
